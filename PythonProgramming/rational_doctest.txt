Notes
-----
This file contains a series of doctests which, if passed, should give a high degree of confidence that the tested
module meets its requirements. Store your program and this file in the same directory.

Remember that this test file is a good guide to the requirements, so the closer you get to a clean test result,
the closer your program is likely to be to the requirements.
